# Introduction to Java

Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language used to build web apps, mobile applications, and enterprise software systems. It is known for its **Write Once, Run Anywhere** capability, which means code written in Java can run on any device that supports the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It is one of the most popular and widely used programming language and platform. A platform is an environment that helps to develop and run programs written in any programming language.

## **Java Environment** 

The programming environment of Java consists of three components mainly:



### **Run the Compiled Java Program**

```java
java HelloWorld
```

__Why `.class` is not included in the java command:__ When running a Java program, the java command expects a class name with the `main()` method specified. The command java HelloWorld.class is an incorrect command, this will cause an error because the JVM is looking for a class named HelloWorld.class, not HelloWorld.
