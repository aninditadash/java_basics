# Introduction to Java

Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language used to build web apps, mobile applications, and enterprise software systems. It is platform-independent, which means we can write code once and run it anywhere using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) (**Write Once, Run Anywhere**). It is one of the most popular and widely used programming language and platform. A platform is an environment that helps to develop and run programs written in any programming language.

### **Key Features of Java**



## **Table of contents**


## **Java Environment** 

The programming environment of Java consists of three components mainly: __JDK__, __JRE__, __JVM__.

### **Java Development Kit (JDK)**

JDK enables the development and execution of Java programs. It is a set of development tools and libraries used to create Java programs. It works together with the JVM and JRE to run and build Java applications.

- Platform-dependent (OS specific - different version for windows, Linux, macOS).
- JDK is only for development (it is not needed for running Java programs).
- Includes JRE (to execute the java program) + Development tools (javac/compilers, debugger, etc.).
- Used for writing and compiling Java code.

#### **Working of JDK**

- __Java Source File (e.g., Example.java):__ You write the Java program in a source file.
- __Compilation:__ The source file is compiled by the Java Compiler (part of JDK) into bytecode, which is stored in a `.class` file (e.g., Example.class).
- __Execution:__ The bytecode is executed by the JVM, which interprets the bytecode and runs the Java program.

### **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**

JRE provides an environment to run Java programs on the system. The environment includes Standard Libraries and JVM.

- Used to run Java applications.
- Platform-dependent (OS specific).
- Includes JVM + Libraries (e.g., rt.jar) and other components.
- Used for running a Java application on a system.

#### **Working of JRE**

When you run a Java program, the following steps occur:

- __Class Loader:__ The JREâ€™s class loader loads the `.class` file containing the bytecode into memory.
- __Bytecode Verifier:__ JRE includes a bytecode verifier to ensure security before execution.
- __Interpreter:__ JVM uses an interpreter + JIT compiler to execute bytecode for optimal performance.
- __Execution:__ The program executes, making calls to the underlying hardware and system resources as needed.

The following actions occur at runtime as listed below: Class Loader -> Byte Code Verifier -> Interpreter -> Executes the Byte Code, Make appropriate calls to the underlying hardware.

### **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** 

JVM is responsible for executing the Java program. The Java program run using JRE or JDK goes into JVM and JVM is responsible for executing the java program line by line, hence it is also known as an interpreter, but it also utilizes a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for performance optimization. JVM is a very important part of both JDK and JRE because it is contained or inbuilt in both.

- Executes Java bytecode, and converts bytecode into native machine code.
- JVM is OS-specific/platform-dependent, but bytecode (`.class` files) is platform-independent (same `.class` file runs in any JVM).
- Includes ClassLoader, JIT Compiler, Garbage Collector, etc.
- While JVM interprets bytecode instructions one by one when running in interpreter-only mode, the JIT compiler translates frequently executed bytecode into native machine code during runtime.

JVM is platform-independent in the sense that the bytecode can run on any machine with a JVM, but the actual JVM implementation is platform-dependent. Different operating systems (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS) require different JVM implementations that interact with the specific OS and hardware.

### **Run the Compiled Java Program**

```java
javac HelloWorld.java
java HelloWorld
```

__Why `.class` is not included in the java command:__ When running a Java program, the java command expects a class name with the `main()` method specified. `javac` command compiles the `HelloWorld.java` file and generates `HelloWorld.class` file. After compilation, the command `java HelloWorld.class` is an incorrect command, this will cause an error because the JVM will look for a class named _HelloWorld.class, not HelloWorld_. Starting with Java SE 11/JDK 11, Java introduced the ability to launch a single-file source-code program with the java launcher, without first needing to explicitly compile the source code. This works by the java launcher automatically invoking the compiler and storing the compiled code in-memory.

```java
java HelloWorld.java
```

### **How JVM Works - JVM Architecture**

## **Datatypes in Java**

Java is statically typed programming language which means variable types are known at the compile time. In Java, compiler knows exactly what types each variable holds and enforces correct usage during compilation. Data types in Java are of different sizes and values that can be stored in a variable that is made as per convenience and circumstances to handle different scenarios or data requirements.

A language is __statically typed__ if the type of a variable is known at compile time. So, the variable's data type is checked at compile time (before the program runs) rather than at runtime (when the program is executing). This allows compilers to catch type-related errors early on, potentially preventing runtime crashes and improving code reliability. 

Java data types are categorized into two main groups: Primitive Data Types and Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types.

### **Primitive Data Types**

These are the basic building blocks that store simple values directly in memory. They store only single values and have no additional capabilities.  They have a fixed size and are stored in the stack memory when declared as local variables within a method. If a primitive is a field within an object, it resides in the heap memory alongside the object.

There are eight primitive data types:

- __Integer Types:__ byte: 1 byte (8 bits), short: 2 bytes (16 bits), int: 4 bytes (32 bits) - Default for integer values, long: 8 bytes (64 bits).
- __Floating-Point Types:__ float: 4 bytes (32 bits) - Single-precision, double: 8 bytes (64 bits) - Double-precision, default for decimal values.
- __Character Type:__ char - is a single 16-bit Unicode character with the size of 2 bytes (16 bits).
- __Boolean Type:__ boolean: Typically 1 byte (actual size can vary depending on JVM). Stores true or false.

__Why Java has char size as 2 bytes:__ Unlike languages such as C/C++ that use the _ASCII character set_ (7-bit code), Java uses the _Unicode character set to support internationalization_. Unicode requires more than 8 bits to represent a wide range of characters from different languages, including Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Chinese, Arabic, etc. As a result, Java uses 2 bytes to store a char, ensuring it can represent any Unicode character.

Assigning a literal number that is outside of the valid range for a variable will throw an error.
